* Setup
** Configure doas
```sh
su
echo "permit nopass keepenv [username]" > /etc/doas.conf # Keep in mind $USER is root here. There [username] needs to be manually replaced with your username.
exit
** Install the configuration
```
doas pkg_add git
git clone https://github.com/olav35/openbsd /tmp/openbsd
mv /tmp/openbsd/* ~
mv /tmp/openbsd/.* ~
```
At this point the system is configured to use my cwm configuration instead of the default fvwm based one. Now you should reboot to enter a much more pleasurable window manager (imo). Therein pressing 4-Return opens xterm. 4-Return is cwm for Win-Enter.
